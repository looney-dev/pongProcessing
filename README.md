# pongProcessing

## Pong game created in Processing for CDV course "Creative programming".

### Assignment requirements:

In the Processing environment, create a Pong game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) for two players - each of them controls rectangles representing paddles using the keyboard, bouncing a disk between them. The disk bounces off the top and bottom edges of the window but not off the left and right edges. If a player fails to hit the incoming disk, the opponent scores a point.
